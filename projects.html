  <h1>My Projects</h1>

  <p>
    This collection features posters and Figma UI designs I created to explore visually engaging and user-friendly concepts.
    I used tools like Figma and Canva, focusing on clean layouts and thoughtful design choices.
    I'm still learning, and I look forward to improving and doing my best with every project.
  </p>

  <h2>Poster and Logo Designs</h2>

  <p>
    These are my very first poster designs created using Canva.<br>
    Through these, I explored the basics of layout, color combinations, text hierarchy, and visual balance.<br>
    This is where my creative journey began — blending design with storytelling.

    I designed this logo for  Azure logo competition, our college’s main fest.
  </p>
  <img src="Projects/AZURE '25.png" alt="Azure Logo">

  <p style="font-size: 24px;">
    Though I initially tried to include too many details, I later realized that a good logo should be simple and not explain everything.<br>
    Through this experience—and many other design attempts—I’m still learning and improving.
