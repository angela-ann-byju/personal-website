  <h1> My Projects</h1>

  <p>
    Welcome to my project showcase! Here, you'll find some of the designs I’ve created using tools like <strong>Figma</strong> and <strong>Canva</strong>.<br>
    Each design reflects a small step in my journey of exploring creativity and visual storytelling. 🌟</h1>
  </p>

  <h2> Poster and Logo Designs</h2>

  <p><h3>
    These posters were my first dive into design using Canva.<br>
    I learned about layout, balance, and how to bring ideas to life visually.</h3>

    At first, I added too many details... then I learned: simplicity is key in a good logo.<br>
    Every design teaches me something new — and I’m growing with each step!</h1> </h1>
